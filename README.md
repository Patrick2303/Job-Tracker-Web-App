# Job-Tracker-Web-App

Job Tracker is a modern web application that allows users to track their internship/job hunting
efforts. Users can use the application to track applications, contacts, and skills as well as the
relationships between each. Skills can be added to applications from the existing skills database
or created brand new on the fly. Users can also rate their proficiency in each skill. Applications
can link to multiple contacts and vice versa. Links to external postings such as glassdoor can
also be included in each application.
